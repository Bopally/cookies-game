## How to play

- **Objective:** Move the cookie character _left and right using the arrow keys_ to collect all the necessary ingredients for the recipe displayed on the screen.
- **Avoid Obstacles:** Beware of obstacles falling from the sky! If you hit them, you lose a life. Keep an eye on your life counter, represented by hearts.
- **Life Management:** You start with _3 lives_. You lose a life if you touch the flames or if you collide with an ingredient that has already been collected.
- **Use the Shield:** Press the _space bar_ to activate a shield that temporarily protects the cookie from the fire only. The shield lasts for 5 seconds and takes 10 seconds to recharge. Use it wisely!
- **Complete the Recipe:** Successfully gather all required ingredients to complete the recipe and win the game! ðŸ¤©
